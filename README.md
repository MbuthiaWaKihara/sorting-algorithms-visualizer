# Purpose
<p>This project is a web app that is useful for demonstrating how some of the common sorting algorithms work.</p>
<p>The app features the insertion sort, selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort and the quick sort</p>
<p>This project puts a lot of focus in being beginner friendly, it hopes to achieve a scenario where a student or programming professional
understands sorting algorithms by closely following visual illustrations of the algorithms at work</p>
<p>Along with some interfaces for choosing the sorting algorithms and order, the app comes with a brief guide that explains how
the application uses colors and patterns to visualize sorting. This guide is in the notes page, navigate to the page using the side nav</p>

# How to set up the project
<p>Ensure you have a stable version of Node.js installed</p>
<ol>
    <li>Clone the repo</li>
    <li>Open your terminal inside the repo folder and run npm install</li>
    <li>Run npm start</li>
</ol>

# Contributing
<p>We would love your contribution. The app runs ReactJS. Here's some guides on how to contribute</p>
<ol>
    <li>Fork the repo</li>
    <li>Set up the repo on your machine as described in the previous topic</li>
    <li>Create a branch where you'll be pushing your changes</li>
    <li>Open a pull request</li>
</ol>

# Known bugs
<p>The UI messes up in small screens.</p>
<p>Merge sort may display a bit of animation anomaly, but this does not affect the visualization fundamentally.</p>

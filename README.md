# Purpose
<p>This project demonstrates how the logic involved in creating the game of chess can be implemented using React.js. In an initial intent to experiment, I found that React can be a handy way of writing the game of chess. In a near future, I intend to make this repo focus on code reusability to enable other coders to create cool chess apps with the chess logic abstracted away.</p>
